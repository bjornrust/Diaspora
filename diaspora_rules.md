**Deck contents**

Each deck includes 60 cards: 21 _Nodes_ and 39 _Colony_ cards. Colonies are divided equally between the three _Colony_ types; _Culture_, _Military_ and _Economy_. Each _Colony_ type has three levels — 2x level three, 4x level two and 7x level one.

**Features**

* 2–4 players
* Ages: 12 and up
* Play Time: 30min+

**Rules**

There are two types of cards: _Nodes_ and _Colonies_. The aim of the game is to control as many _Nodes_ as possible with your _Colonies_ before the game is over. The game is over when:

1. the deck is depleted (resources depleted), or
2. a player cannot perform any action (trapped), or
3. all _Nodes_ are under one player’s control (domination), or
4. a player loses control of all their _Nodes_ (eradication).

Players gain control over _Nodes_ either by colonising unoccupied _Nodes_ or invading _Nodes_ occupied by an opponent. A _Node_ is considered occupied by a player when that player’s _Colony_ is the topmost card. (The arrow at the bottom of each _Colony_ indicates the controlling player.)

When invading, the victor is decided according to the following rules:

* For _Colony_ cards of the same type; the card with highest numerical value prevails.
* For _Colony_ cards of different type but same numerical value; _Culture_ trumps _Military_, _Military_ trumps _Economy_ and _Economy_ trumps _Culture_.
* For _Colony_ cards of different type and different numerical value; the trump card of higher value prevails.

**Setup**

Take Nodes from the deck to form the board as shown:

To choose who goes first, each player draws a card from the deck at random and pits it against their opponents. The victor is the first to play. If there is no victor, the process repeats until there is. Once the first player is chosen, shuffle the deck and deal 5 cards to each player. Turns proceed clockwise.

**Turn Phases** (performed in order)

1. **Draw** – Draw one card from the deck.

Players must then perform at least one of the following actions:

2. **Explore** – play one _Node_ next to a _Node_ you control.
3. **Colonise** – play one _Colony_ on or next to a _Node_ you control. Note: During the first round, players can colonise any _Node_.
4. **Invade/Move** – move a superior _Colony_ you control on top of an opponents _Colony_. Cards may not be moved diagonally. When a new _Colony_ overpowers another, the latter is oppressed. If the oppressing _Colony_ ever moves off that _Node_, the oppressed _Colony_ regains control. If a _Colony_ can overpower another, it can also move through that _Colony_ unimpeded. The same _Colony_ may not be placed and moved in the same turn.
